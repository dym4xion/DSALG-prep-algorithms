exploring:
- bubble sort (p/j)
- binary search (p/j)
- quicksort (p/j)
- insertion sort (p/j)
- selection sort (p/j)
- linear search (p/j)

## Additional Algorithms Created From Set Exercises
- iterative algorithm to reverse the order of a list (p)
- recursive algorithm to reverse the order of a list (p)
- recursive algorithm to sum 1 to n numbers (where n is a positive integer) (p)
- recursive digital sum algorithm (p)
- recursive algorithm to find greatest common divisor (p)
- recursive algorithm to print a range between two integers (p)

## Future Challenges
- implement dijkstra's algorithm in python and/or java (WIP)   

algorithms implemented in (p)ython and (j)ava
